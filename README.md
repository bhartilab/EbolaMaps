This repository contains digitized maps as well as code for figures found in the manuscript entitled: Human movement and transmission dynamics early in Ebola outbreaks

Authors: Gonzalez, Nikparvar, Matson, Seifert, Ross, Munster, and Bharti 

**Digitized maps** 

Contains all files (.dbf, .prj, .shp, .shx) necessary to utilize the digitized maps created for  300 km x 300 km surrounding each of the 18 spillover events described in this study. The digitized maps were 'corrected' to resolve extra or dangling nodes. Please contact Nita Bharti for the original set of maps.  

**Code** 

**Network transportation and outbreak analysis:** 

linear_regression_models.R: Linear regression analyses for transportation networks and outbreak measures for Figure 3, Figures S2, S3, and S4.

outbreak_network_characteristics.R: Contains 1) the outbreak total cases and total cases in the first 100 days analysis for Figure 1b and 2) Network characteristics for roads and rivers for Figure 2. 

**Sensitivity analysis:**
