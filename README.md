# EbolaMaps
This repository contains digitized maps and code for figures found in the manuscript entitled: **Human movement and transmission dynamics early in Ebola outbreaks**

Authors: Gonzalez, Nikparvar, Matson, Seifert, Ross, Munster, Bharti 

**Digitized maps** 

Contains all essential files (.dbf, .prj, .shp, .shx) required for the utilization of the digitized maps created for the 300 km x 300 km area encompassing each of the 18 spillover events documented in this study. We 'corrected' the digitized maps to resolve extra or dangling nodes. Please contact Nita Bharti for the original set of maps.  

**Code** 

**Network transportation and outbreak analysis:** 

linear_regression_models.R: Linear regression analyses for transportation networks and outbreak measures for Figure 3, Figures S2, S3, and S4.

outbreak_network_characteristics.R: Contains 1) Analysis of the outbreak total cases and total cases in the first 100 days for Figure 1b and 2) Network characteristics for roads and rivers for Figure 2. 

**Sensitivity analysis:**

sensitivity_analysis.py: Correlations between transportation networks and outbreak measures by study area for Figure S1.
